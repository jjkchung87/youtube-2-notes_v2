and we have the
1125.12 - 1129.28: start index
1126.799 - 1130.8799999999999: this is just a reminder start index
1129.28 - 1134.24: end index
1130.88 - 1137.3600000000001: and then finally the step size
1134.24 - 1140.0: so if i wanted to let's say get
1137.36 - 1141.84: between the numbers two and six every
1140.0 - 1143.36: other element so two
1141.84 - 1147.039: four and six
1143.36 - 1149.6: well to specify that i would do
1147.039 - 1151.76: well i want the first row
1149.6 - 1153.36: and then i want to start at the first
1151.76 - 1154.72: element
1153.36 - 1156.0: the two
1154.72 - 1158.799: and i actually screw that up it should
1156.0 - 1160.88: be one so i start at the two then i want
1158.799 - 1164.08: to end here at the six
1160.88 - 1166.5590000000002: which is the
1164.08 - 1168.24: it's exclusive so that would be
1166.559 - 1170.16: uh i want to actually go to the sixth
1168.24 - 1172.08: element and then i want to
1170.16 - 1174.559: step by two because i wanted two four
1172.08 - 1177.28: six so i do one six two
1174.559 - 1180.32: and that gives me two four six and i can
1177.28 - 1181.84: also use the negative here and do like
1180.32 - 1184.0: negative two
1181.84 - 1185.9189999999999: ah what happened there oh shoot that was
1184.0 - 1188.559: going backwards i didn't want to change
1185.919 - 1190.48: it there i wanted to change the six to
1188.559 - 1192.72: be negative two
1190.48 - 1194.64: ah okay it's exclusive so i wanted this
1192.72 - 1196.24: to actually be negative one
1194.64 - 1197.2800000000002: a little bit more of a fancy way to do
1196.24 - 1200.32: that
1197.28 - 1201.52: okay so that's how you access elements
1200.32 - 1202.96: and then if we wanted to change
1201.52 - 1205.039: something it's pretty straightforward
1202.96 - 1207.6000000000001: too let's say i wanted to change that 13
1205.039 - 1209.76: that i originally accessed
1207.6 - 1210.6399999999999: well i can just do
1209.76 - 1211.6: like
1210.64 - 1214.7990000000002: 20.
1211.6 - 1214.799: if i print out a now
1215.039 - 1218.24: that original element that was 13 is now
1217.28 - 1220.3999999999999: 20
1218.24 - 1222.0: and you can do the same thing for
1220.4 - 1224.3200000000002: um
1222.0 - 1225.76: series of numbers so like for an entire
1224.32 - 1227.9189999999999: column let's say we wanted to replace
1225.76 - 1230.72: this 310 column
1227.919 - 1232.88: i would do something like
1230.72 - 1235.1200000000001: a
1232.88 - 1237.7600000000002: colon two
1235.12 - 1239.12: equals let's say i wanted it to be all
1237.76 - 1242.0: fives
1239.12 - 1245.4399999999998: i could start like this
1242.0 - 1246.72: and as you see it's all fives five five
1245.44 - 1248.0: and then if i wanted it to be two
1246.72 - 1250.88: different numbers you just kind of
1248.0 - 1252.88: specify the same shape as
1250.88 - 1254.24: what you've subsequent so it'd be like
1252.88 - 1256.48: one two
1254.24 - 1259.36: so now you see that we have a one two in
1256.48 - 1259.3600000000001: that's position
1259.76 - 1264.1589999999999: really quickly let's just show a 3d
1262.0 - 1269.28: example
1264.159 - 1269.2800000000002: if i had a 3d so we'll say b equals
1273.679 - 1280.799: numpy array of all this and if i print
1278.72 - 1280.799: b
1283.84 - 1286.799: so if we want to get a specific element
1285.6 - 1288.6399999999999: here
1286.799 - 1291.6: the recommendation i have is work
1288.64 - 1294.0800000000002: outside in so work outside in so let's
1291.6 - 1297.28: say i wanted this four right here
1294.08 - 1299.52: well the farthest outside would be which
1297.28 - 1302.48: one of these do i want and i want the
1299.52 - 1305.039: first set so i want this area right here
1302.48 - 1308.24: so if i wanted that i would do b
1305.039 - 1310.559: zero and then now that i'm in here i
1308.24 - 1312.24: want the second row
1310.559 - 1313.84: so i want the three four
1312.24 - 1317.28: so that would be one
1313.84 - 1318.799: and now that i'm within this i want the
1317.28 - 1320.6399999999999: first
1318.799 - 1322.24: or the second yeah the second element
1320.64 - 1324.48: but the first index
1322.24 - 1326.88: like that so that gives me the four and
1324.48 - 1329.44: you can do similar type stuff with like
1326.88 - 1331.8400000000001: the colons in here so each one of these
1329.44 - 1333.6000000000001: dimensions that you're indexing you can
1331.84 - 1335.76: be all fancy with
1333.6 - 1337.6: uh how you access elements so i can do
1335.76 - 1338.799: something like this
1337.6 - 1341.6: and
1338.799 - 1343.2: you know get three four seven eight you
1341.6 - 1344.559: can kind of play around with this and
1343.2 - 1346.32: see how
1344.559 - 1348.08: changing different things changes what
1346.32 - 1349.52: you get
1348.08 - 1350.72: and if you wanted to replace in this
1349.52 - 1352.4: case
1350.72 - 1354.159: um
1352.4 - 1356.96: basically you just have to create a
1354.159 - 1359.1200000000001: subsequence tha
