3006.88 - 3009.76: write in the comments if you have any
3008.079 - 3011.04: questions about this
3009.76 - 3012.6400000000003: okay the second thing i want to go
3011.04 - 3013.52: through is
3012.64 - 3015.1189999999997: um
3013.52 - 3017.44: what happened there
3015.119 - 3019.6800000000003: i didn't want that to be marked down
3017.44 - 3019.68: ah
3019.839 - 3023.44: the second thing i want to go through
3020.96 - 3024.839: with this miscellaneous section is
3023.44 - 3028.16: some
3024.839 - 3031.2: advanced indexing so there's some really
3028.16 - 3032.8799999999997: cool stuff you can do with numpy
3031.2 - 3035.04: i'm going to say
3032.88 - 3036.319: boolean
3035.04 - 3038.319: masking
3036.319 - 3039.7599999999998: and advanced
3038.319 - 3042.72: indexing
3039.76 - 3045.44: so what can we do here so let's say i
3042.72 - 3045.4399999999996: wanted to learn
3045.52 - 3050.559: where in file data
3048.16 - 3052.839: the value is greater than 50. so if i
3050.559 - 3055.599: just type in file data greater than
3052.839 - 3056.88: 50. it's pretty cool that you
3055.599 - 3058.7200000000003: get
3056.88 - 3061.119: false or true based on whether that
3058.72 - 3062.9599999999996: specific location was greater than 50.
3061.119 - 3065.04: so as you can see there's four falses
3062.96 - 3068.319: and then a true if we go to our data
3065.04 - 3070.16: four falses and then 196 is in fact
3068.319 - 3071.7599999999998: greater than 50.
3070.16 - 3073.5989999999997: so that's like one way and you can do
3071.76 - 3075.6800000000003: all sorts of cool stuff with it it's
3073.599 - 3076.559: like you could do greater than equal to
3075.68 - 3079.04: you know
3076.559 - 3080.559: all sorts of different combinations
3079.04 - 3082.4: one thing that's pretty neat is you can
3080.559 - 3083.599: do file data
3082.4 - 3085.92: and then you can
3083.599 - 3088.8: index based on
3085.92 - 3089.52: where it is greater than 50.
3088.8 - 3093.599: and
3089.52 - 3095.359: by doing this you grab only the
3093.599 - 3097.2000000000003: values that actually have a value
3095.359 - 3099.2799999999997: greater than 50.
3097.2 - 3101.68: so that is pretty cool and kind of the
3099.28 - 3104.0: reason that this right here works is
3101.68 - 3106.72: that one thing i did not
3104.0 - 3109.359: mention until now
3106.72 - 3113.2: is that you can
3109.359 - 3114.88: can index with a list in numpy which is
3113.2 - 3116.72: pretty cool so if you have the
3114.88 - 3120.48: array
3116.72 - 3121.52: one two three four five six seven eight
3120.48 - 3123.28: nine
3121.52 - 3127.2: and i wanted let's say
3123.28 - 3129.599: the zeroth spot the second spot and then
3127.2 - 3132.0789999999997: the last spot
3129.599 - 3136.1600000000003: i could do
3132.079 - 3137.92: mp or let's say that this is a
3136.16 - 3139.44: i could do
3137.92 - 3140.96: a of
3139.44 - 3143.28: 0
3140.96 - 3143.28: 1
3143.359 - 3147.2799999999997: and or i wanted 2 3 and 9 so i would do
3146.4 - 3148.2400000000002: 1
3147.28 - 3150.559: 2
3148.24 - 3152.4799999999996: and then 8.
3150.559 - 3153.44: as you see that gives me two three and
3152.48 - 3155.68: nine i
3153.44 - 3158.079: passed in a list and it indexed those
3155.68 - 3161.04: spots so basically it also works
3158.079 - 3163.3590000000004: if you like had trues and falses it like
3161.04 - 3165.359: basically if it is true then it knows to
3163.359 - 3167.5989999999997: take it if it's false doesn't so that's
3165.359 - 3170.0789999999997: why this up here
3167.599 - 3170.079: works
3178.88 - 3181.92: we could do all sorts of other things so
3180.48 - 3184.8: let's say
3181.92 - 3187.44: um i wanted to figure out
3184.8 - 3190.88: if any value in any of these columns was
3187.44 - 3192.88: greater than 50 so i can do a
3190.88 - 3195.599: np.any
3192.88 - 3197.28: file data greater than 50
3195.599 - 3199.92: and the axis
3197.28 - 3201.8390000000004: of zero so that should tell me like if
3199.92 - 3204.0: we looked downwards
3201.839 - 3206.72: on all of these are any of the values
3204.0 - 3210.079: greater than 50. let's see what happens
3206.72 - 3211.4399999999996: so false false false false true that's
3210.079 - 3212.88: correct
3211.44 - 3215.359: true these two values are greater than
3212.88 - 3217.04: 50 this even though this one isn't
3215.359 - 3218.0: um
3217.04 - 3218.47: false
3218.0 - 3220.88: true
3218.47 - 3223.4399999999996: [Music]
3220.88 - 3225.52: yeah true true false true
3223.44 - 3227.28: cool so this is telling us you know
3225.52 - 3228.8: where what columns have a value greater
3227.28 - 3233.1600000000003: than 50
3228.8 - 3233.1600000000003: and i can also do np.all
3233.68 - 3238.0: and as you can see there's less trues in
3235.68 - 3240.16: this case i think the only time that all
3238.0 - 3241.2: the values are greater than 50 are right
3240.16 - 3242.8799999999997: here
3241.2 - 3244.16: yeah you see there's one true in the
3242.88 - 3247.04: fifth spo
