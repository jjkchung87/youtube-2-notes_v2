t
3244.16 - 3251.2799999999997: which corresponds to this right here
3247.04 - 3253.119: uh what else can we do with this
3251.28 - 3254.2400000000002: um
3253.119 - 3257.119: if you
3254.24 - 3259.839: did axis equals one
3257.119 - 3262.2400000000002: it's gonna be the rows
3259.839 - 3264.5589999999997: you can also do multiple conditions so i
3262.24 - 3267.04: could do like
3264.559 - 3269.8390000000004: i want file data to be
3267.04 - 3270.8: greater than 50
3269.839 - 3274.0789999999997: and
3270.8 - 3276.2400000000002: let's say file data is less than 100 and
3274.079 - 3279.6800000000003: this syntax is very similar to pandas
3276.24 - 3281.68: here and as i said before numpy builds
3279.68 - 3282.72: is what's the base of panda so it makes
3281.68 - 3285.2799999999997: sense
3282.72 - 3285.2799999999997: ah no
3286.16 - 3288.8799999999997: the
3287.04 - 3290.4: truth value of an array with more than
3288.88 - 3293.28: one element
3290.4 - 3295.76: is ambiguous how do i do this
3293.28 - 3298.2400000000002: i think if i do something like this it
3295.76 - 3298.2400000000002: will work
3302.48 - 3307.04: not positive let's see
3305.44 - 3309.119: yeah what happened
3307.04 - 3311.599: no i need to end it
3309.119 - 3312.799: yeah cool so this is all the values that
3311.599 - 3314.7200000000003: are
3312.799 - 3316.96: greater than 50 but less than 100 so
3314.72 - 3321.1189999999997: like the first true should happen at the
3316.96 - 3322.64: sixth spot one two three four five six
3321.119 - 3326.079: as you see
3322.64 - 3326.0789999999997: uh and i could do something like
3326.16 - 3329.839: all the spots if i wanted to
3328.079 - 3330.799: make all this
3329.839 - 3331.92: not
3330.799 - 3334.96: so this
3331.92 - 3337.04: means not greater than 50 and less than
3334.96 - 3339.119: 100 this is going to be the reverse of
3337.04 - 3342.0: what we just did
3339.119 - 3343.359: so yeah now the
3342.0 - 3346.64: um
3343.359 - 3349.119: sixth spot is the first false
3346.64 - 3350.799: so this meant not so yeah all sorts of
3349.119 - 3354.319: cool stuff you can do with this boolean
3350.799 - 3356.48: masking and advanced indexing
3354.319 - 3358.079: i mean yeah any sort of like condition
3356.48 - 3360.2400000000002: i'll put a link and some more
3358.079 - 3363.119: information about this all right quick
3360.24 - 3364.799: little quiz on uh indexing this is kind
3363.119 - 3366.1600000000003: of using all sorts of advanced stuff
3364.799 - 3368.079: that you just learned in that last
3366.16 - 3370.64: section include and then also like some
3368.079 - 3373.599: of the original stuff so first question
3370.64 - 3374.8799999999997: uh basically pause the video after i ask
3373.599 - 3377.52: it and then try to figure out what the
3374.88 - 3379.92: command would be so we have this matrix
3377.52 - 3382.559: and how would you index this part of the
3379.92 - 3382.559: matrix
3385.599 - 3388.88: so this is the
3389.359 - 3393.68: second and third row and the first and
3392.319 - 3396.319: second column
3393.68 - 3399.1189999999997: or zero and first column so it looks
3396.319 - 3399.119: something like this
3399.2 - 3403.52: rows columns
3400.88 - 3405.28: next question how would you index
3403.52 - 3407.52: this this is something we haven't done
3405.28 - 3409.76: before but you potentially with that
3407.52 - 3412.799: last section might have an idea
3409.76 - 3412.7990000000004: if not no worries
3414.559 - 3417.6800000000003: so to do this one
3417.76 - 3422.4: you need to use two different lists
3421.04 - 3423.92: within your
3422.4 - 3427.119: uh indexing
3423.92 - 3429.52: so it's gonna look something like this
3427.119 - 3431.2000000000003: we need the zeroth first second and
3429.52 - 3433.04: third row
3431.2 - 3435.7599999999998: and then the first second third and
3433.04 - 3438.319: fourth columns that's what that is and
3435.76 - 3440.88: then final question
3438.319 - 3443.119: how would you index this
3440.88 - 3444.799: this is like also something we haven't
3443.119 - 3446.96: immediately looked at but you might be
3444.799 - 3449.2: able to get especially with that last
3446.96 - 3449.2: one
3449.28 - 3452.1600000000003: take a second
3454.24 - 3458.799: all right that would look something like
3457.04 - 3460.88: this
3458.799 - 3462.559: where you get the zeroth fourth and
3460.88 - 3464.6400000000003: fifth row zero
3462.559 - 3467.52: fourth and fifth rows
3464.64 - 3469.68: and then you want columns three onwards
3467.52 - 3471.359: so this would
3469.68 - 3473.2799999999997: like three onwards works you could also
3471.359 - 3475.2799999999997: do like three to five
3473.28 - 3477.52: you'd also do three or like a list of
3475.28 - 3479.3590000000004: three four but yeah that's one way to do
3477.52 - 3481.359: it it's a fun little quiz i don't know
3479.359 - 3482.799: it's i guess good to revisit this type
3481.359 - 3483.68: of thing and like think critically about
348
