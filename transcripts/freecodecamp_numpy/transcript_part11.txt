 sorts of functions you can do on
2315.68 - 2318.96: elements
2316.8 - 2320.7200000000003: uh linear algebra so this is like really
2318.96 - 2322.7200000000003: i feel like when i'm using matlab it
2320.72 - 2326.72: would be doing these linear algebra type
2322.72 - 2328.3999999999996: stuff so let's say we have two matrices
2326.72 - 2330.7999999999997: and the big difference with linear
2328.4 - 2332.48: algebra is like we're not doing element
2330.8 - 2334.6400000000003: wise so like
2332.48 - 2337.119: in this case this b
2334.64 - 2340.3199999999997: we're doing element-wise computation so
2337.119 - 2340.32: like a times b
2342.16 - 2346.48: in you know linear algebra you're trying
2344.72 - 2350.48: to multiply matrices and that's a
2346.48 - 2350.48: different process so let's say we have
2350.72 - 2353.839: two matrices we'll have a
2352.56 - 2355.68: and i'm going to use the syntax we
2353.839 - 2361.2799999999997: learned about earlier i'm going to say
2355.68 - 2361.2799999999997: this is a 2 by 3 matrix of all twos
2361.68 - 2367.52: or actually let's make this
2364.079 - 2369.2000000000003: 2 by 3 matrix of ones
2367.52 - 2372.88: so we have a
2369.2 - 2372.8799999999997: as you can see and then we'll have
2373.92 - 2380.64: b which is equal to np dot full
2377.76 - 2383.2000000000003: it's going to be a 3 by 2
2380.64 - 2385.839: and it's going to be a value 2.
2383.2 - 2388.0: so if i print out b
2385.839 - 2390.7999999999997: now we have this and if you remember
2388.0 - 2393.52: linear algebra you have to have the
2390.8 - 2394.88: columns of the first matrix be the equal
2393.52 - 2396.64: to the
2394.88 - 2398.7200000000003: rows of the second one so as you can see
2396.64 - 2400.7999999999997: this says three columns and this has
2398.72 - 2403.7599999999998: three rows so we're good there so we
2400.8 - 2406.1600000000003: would multiply this row by this column
2403.76 - 2407.599: um and you know you do the the process
2406.16 - 2408.72: of matric multiplication we're not going
2407.599 - 2411.119: to walk through the whole thing but we
2408.72 - 2416.16: should end up with a 2
2411.119 - 2416.1600000000003: by 2 matrix at the end if we want to do
2416.4 - 2419.28: matrix multiplication and it doesn't
2417.92 - 2420.64: just automatically occur if you try to
2419.28 - 2422.0: do a times b
2420.64 - 2425.7599999999998: it's not going to work because these are
2422.0 - 2427.92: different sizes so we can do is mp has a
2425.76 - 2430.7200000000003: matrix multiply function and if i pass
2427.92 - 2432.2400000000002: an a then pass in b
2430.72 - 2436.48: we get
2432.24 - 2439.2799999999997: 6 6 6 6. did i say enough sixes
2436.48 - 2440.96: i don't know but uh yeah it uh multiply
2439.28 - 2441.8390000000004: those two matrices
2440.96 - 2443.839: um
2441.839 - 2445.599: you know and if i try to switch up this
2443.839 - 2447.7599999999998: dimension in the middle
2445.599 - 2450.56: uh it's not gonna work because it's now
2447.76 - 2450.5600000000004: incompatible
2450.88 - 2454.4: uh yeah that's matrix multiplication
2453.119 - 2456.56: you could also want to do maybe some
2454.4 - 2459.52: other stuff with matrices so let's
2456.56 - 2459.92: imagine i wanted to create the or to
2459.52 - 2461.04: find the
2459.92 - 2462.88: [Music]
2461.04 - 2465.2: um
2462.88 - 2467.92: let's say determinant of a matrix so
2465.2 - 2469.4399999999996: we could as a sanity check you know make
2467.92 - 2472.4: c equal the
2469.44 - 2474.2400000000002: identity matrix and if you are familiar
2472.4 - 2476.96: with linear algebra you know that
2474.24 - 2478.7999999999997: the identity matrix has a determinant of
2476.96 - 2480.7200000000003: one
2478.8 - 2482.079: so if i do linear algebra dot
2480.72 - 2484.56: determinant
2482.079 - 2487.28: of c we should get one
2484.56 - 2490.96: 1.0 as we get so
2487.28 - 2490.96: find the determinant
2491.76 - 2496.88: you know there's all sorts of other good
2493.28 - 2500.4: things like eigenvalues
2496.88 - 2502.88: you know the inverse of a matrix so what
2500.4 - 2504.8: what do you multiply by a matrix to get
2502.88 - 2505.599: the identity matrix
2504.8 - 2507.6800000000003: um
2505.599 - 2508.6400000000003: and so yeah all sorts of good stuff on
2507.68 - 2511.7599999999998: that
2508.64 - 2511.7599999999998: like i guess i'll do
2512.48 - 2516.72: and if you want to have all this
2514.72 - 2518.24: information on the other types of linear
2516.72 - 2521.2799999999997: algebra stuff
2518.24 - 2523.68: here is some useful information
2521.28 - 2526.1600000000003: definitely go to this link and as i've
2523.68 - 2528.3999999999996: said a couple times in this video
2526.16 - 2529.7599999999998: this notebook is on my github page so
2528.4 - 2532.079: you can find
2529.76 - 2533.8390000000004: all this there but yeah there's so many
2532.079 - 2536.6400000000003: different things that you can do
2533.839 - 2539.599: with matrices and linear algebra using
