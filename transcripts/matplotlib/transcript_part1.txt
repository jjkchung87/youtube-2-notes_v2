0.06 - 3.419: what's up guys and welcome back to
1.589 - 5.009: another video so in today's video we
3.419 - 7.5600000000000005: will go through the bat plot live
5.009 - 9.48: library of Python and this is a super
7.56 - 12.599: useful library for all things data
9.48 - 14.099: visualization in Python so the video
12.599 - 16.68: will start off with going through the
14.099 - 18.6: matplotlib basics so as you see on the
16.68 - 20.46: screen will be creating like line graphs
18.6 - 22.5: such as the one you see here you'll
20.46 - 24.869: learn how to format these lines in
22.5 - 26.939: different ways you'll be able to add a
24.869 - 30.3: title you'll be able to add labels to
26.939 - 33.12: your x and y-axes format your tick marks
30.3 - 35.13: properly add a legend etc so all the
33.12 - 37.86: kind of basic matplotlib things you want
35.13 - 40.410000000000004: to know then we'll move into other types
37.86 - 42.69: of graphs such as bar charts and we'll
40.41 - 44.669999999999995: finish this video off with going through
42.69 - 46.289: all sorts of like real world examples
44.67 - 49.53: where you can kind of combine your data
46.289 - 51.27: science skills that you might have using
49.53 - 52.44: like pandas library and if you haven't
51.27 - 53.910000000000004: learned anything about the pandas
52.44 - 57.57: library I recommend you watch my video
53.91 - 59.06999999999999: on that so with that the kind of real
57.57 - 61.35: world examples will do stuff such as
59.07 - 64.32: like plot the USA versus Canada gas
61.35 - 67.38: prices off of data that we have a little
64.32 - 70.52999999999999: link to in a CSV we'll do some histogram
67.38 - 73.74: stuff we'll do some pie chart stuff and
70.53 - 76.08: we will do some box and whiskers chart
73.74 - 78.27: stuff I can't get through every type of
76.08 - 79.979: graph in this one video but if there's
78.27 - 81.119: certain things that I didn't cover and
79.979 - 83.58: you really want me to cover it let me
81.119 - 87.99: know in the comments that would be super
83.58 - 90.53999999999999: duper yeah that's all I got to start
87.99 - 92.1: this video let's just jump into it all
90.54 - 93.45: right let's start out by loading in the
92.1 - 95.75: libraries that we need for this tutorial
93.45 - 101.369: so we're an import and map plot live as
95.75 - 105.36: our dot pie plot as peel of T we're
101.369 - 107.759: gonna import numpy as NP and we're gonna
105.36 - 111.72: for the later examples import pandas as
107.759 - 113.57900000000001: PD and run that and so if you have all
111.72 - 115.079: these us like already installed you
113.579 - 116.82: won't get any errors if you do get these
115.079 - 118.16999999999999: get an error when you're trying to run
116.82 - 119.78999999999999: them onto these you find need to install
118.17 - 123.0: it so you can either do a pip install
119.79 - 125.61000000000001: matplotlib pip install numpy pip install
123.0 - 126.78: pandas or you could install a Python
125.61 - 129.149: distribution that already has these
126.78 - 129.8: packages such as anaconda I'll link to
129.149 - 132.11: how to do this
129.8 - 134.57000000000002: the description okay so now we have our
132.11 - 145.85000000000002: libraries loaded let's now build our
134.57 - 147.79999999999998: basic graph so I just think it's kind of
145.85 - 149.48: the hardest part about anything with
147.8 - 153.05: Python in general is starting with that
149.48 - 155.82999999999998: blank blank space so what I recommend
153.05 - 158.69: for matplotlib is always start at the
155.83 - 161.18: documentation so I have a link for this
158.69 - 163.25: in the description but here is the home
161.18 - 165.62: page of the matplotlib pipe lot
163.25 - 166.7: documentation and what I recommend is
165.62 - 169.16: like whenever we're trying to do
166.7 - 171.58999999999997: something new just do a ctrl F and like
169.16 - 173.18: look for it so if we look for plot here
171.59 - 176.93: that's like we're just trying to get a
173.18 - 178.55: line graph on the on the screen box
176.93 - 181.43: plots not only one we don't want it been
178.55 - 183.53: plot okay this looks good plot y versus
181.43 - 186.23000000000002: X as lines or markers so this is what
183.53 - 187.7: we'll start off by doing as you can see
186.23 - 190.48999999999998: right here and the examples it gives
187.7 - 193.48: gives plot X comma y so that's the
190.49 - 196.61: command will F the run to make this work
193.48 - 199.09: and just to know what x and y are if we
196.61 - 201.41000000000003: go down to parameters they tell us that
199.09 - 204.05: commonly these parameters are 1d arrays
201.41 - 208.57999999999998: so we know we need to pass in 1d array
204.05 - 216.83: to the plot function so if we do plot 1
208.58 - 221.78: 2 3 that's gonna be our x + 2 4 6 will
216.83 - 224.84: be our Y I can't type and run that plot
221.78 - 227.239: is not defined so we imported pipe lot
224.84 - 229.82: as plot so when we run this function we
227.239 - 233.66: actually have to do P love T dot plot
229.82 - 235.54999999999998: and then this is our X and the second
233.66 - 238.67: array is our Y so let's see what happens
235.55 - 242.09: there yay we got a graph and to clean
238.67 - 245.51: this up a little bit I recommend moving
242.09 - 251.54: our variables into removing our arrays
245.51 - 258.53: into variables so X is 1 2 3 and Y is 2
251.54 - 260.269: 4 6 and we can change now this to X Y
258.53 - 261.44: and one thing that's annoying with the
260.269 - 263.09000000000003: matplotlib if you're doing this in
261.44 - 265.21999999999997: Jupiter notebook by default is you have
263.09 - 266.45: this annoying little line here so you
265.22 - 270.17: want to get rid of that you can just
266.45 - 271.99: actually call plot dot show and that's
270.17 - 278.09000000000003: the correct way to actually show this
271.99 - 280.97: graph okay now that we have just a line
278.09 - 283.13: on the screen let's start adding a
280.97 - 285.14000000000004: little bit more to our graph so to do
283.13 - 289.7: this let's go back to our documentation
285.14 - 290.93: and go back to just the pie plot so I
289.7 - 292.94: think this is a good spot to start
290.93 - 294.35: because you always can kind of just ctrl
292.94 - 296.03: F and find something you're looking for
294.35 - 300.08000000000004: so let's say we wanted to add a title to
296.03 - 301.52: our graph if I type in title it points
300.08 - 303.38: me right to a couple different places
301.52 - 305.39: that I probably want to look at and
303.38 - 309.43: right here is what we're looking for so
305.39 - 312.28999999999996: set a title for the axes click that and
309.43 - 315.71: this tells me all sorts of stuff about
312.29 - 322.91: how I call this so it looks like I use
315.71 - 331.94: do pie plot title so I can do plot title
322.91 - 335.57000000000005: and let's just do our first graph and
331.94 - 340.06: run that as you can see our title is now
335.57 - 343.46: there and same thing for a lot of the
340.06 - 346.19: different parameters so going back to
343.46 - 349.94: the documentation if I want an X level
346.19 - 353.71999999999997: on a while label I just type in right I
349.94 - 357.83: guess I knew that but let's just say Y
353.72 - 360.62: label nothing comes up Y or just even
357.83 - 363.44: label C label label a contour plot
360.62 - 369.02: that's none of us the fig labels no pie
363.44 - 372.8: no title no X label Y label let's how we
369.02 - 375.26: get there so you can keep doing this and
372.8 - 378.04: really easily find what you're looking
375.26 - 380.9: for I think it's a good place to go if
378.04 - 382.28000000000003: you kind of just if you forget things
380.9 - 385.78999999999996: because I always forget things in that
382.28 - 389.53: plot lid okay so adding a label to x and
385.79 - 393.35: y plot an X label
389.53 - 394.78999999999996: x-axes and I guess I'm getting really
393.35 - 397.87: enthusiastic because we keep adding
394.79 - 400.79: exclamation points to all of my stuff
397.87 - 404.06: y-axes yay
400.79 - 405.5: see what happens yeah and I want to just
404.06 - 408.31: get rid of these recommendations I don't
405.5 - 412.67: need them okay so now we have a graph
408.31 - 415.76: and we have a title and we have y axis x
412.67 - 417.98: axis in a real graph we would label
415.76 - 419.51: these properly but for the sake of this
417.98 - 422.21000000000004: example we're just kind of getting a
419.51 - 424.4: feel for how we add these alright so now
422.21 - 425.78: that we have our title and labels one
424.4 - 430.42999999999995: thing we might want to do to them is
425.78 - 432.71: resize them so if we look at the the
430.43 - 435.41: documentation for title one thing you'll
432.71 - 438.46999999999997: notice is that you can use you can pass
435.41 - 439.91: in this font dictionary and it gives you
438.47 - 442.28000000000003: a little bit of details about the font
439.91 - 444.29: dictionary here but basically there's
442.28 - 446.35999999999996: all sorts of options that we can do and
444.29 - 449.09000000000003: like play around with our font so let's
446.36 - 452.09000000000003: say I wanted to change the font of our
449.09 - 457.76: title a new font dict equals and I can
452.09 - 461.95: pass in a font name and let's say I my
457.76 - 465.71: good old trusty reliable comic sans ms
461.95 - 469.52: will be our new font and if you look at
465.71 - 472.78999999999996: that we got a nice new font on a graph
469.52 - 475.84999999999997: and if you can't see it well then in
472.79 - 479.21000000000004: that case I'll change the font size to
475.85 - 481.37: be something like 20 now you should
479.21 - 485.39: definitely be able to tell that I've
481.37 - 488.0: changed the font type and in the
485.39 - 491.27: description I listed I put a link to all
488.0 - 493.16: the known matplotlib fonts that you can
491.27 - 494.59999
