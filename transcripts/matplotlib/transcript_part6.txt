me and we can easily add some
2693.19 - 2705.4900000000002: more countries here so I could like add
2700.53 - 2709.9300000000003: Australia for example and we'll make
2705.49 - 2712.2999999999997: them ah I don't know what color to use I
2709.93 - 2716.02: don't know that anymore I got a yellow
2712.3 - 2716.4700000000003: shirt it might be ugly color yeah it's
2716.02 - 2718.48: not too bad
2716.47 - 2720.73: but yeah and there we have Australia
2718.48 - 2724.45: looks like they're missing maybe a data
2720.73 - 2725.98: value for 1990 I'm not positive but yeah
2724.45 - 2727.66: we can easily do this for all of our
2725.98 - 2730.09: different graphs and we could even do
2727.66 - 2734.37: something like let's comment this out
2730.09 - 2740.8: temporarily let me do something like for
2734.37 - 2746.23: country in gas let's see what happens at
2740.8 - 2749.23: that print country yeah cool this is
2746.23 - 2752.86: giving us all the different countries we
2749.23 - 2762.3: don't want year so I'm going to say in
2752.86 - 2762.3: gas one onwards now we have Oh No
2765.16 - 2772.49: close close close okay I'm gonna be a
2768.59 - 2779.48: little bit hacky here if country is not
2772.49 - 2781.1899999999996: equal to Year print country now we get
2779.48 - 2784.28: all of the countries and so what we
2781.19 - 2785.9900000000002: could do with this now is you know
2784.28 - 2789.5: that's probable need of a way to do this
2785.99 - 2791.0: then if country is not equal to year but
2789.5 - 2792.98: I'm just trying to show you how like we
2791.0 - 2796.96: can do this very quick and efficient
2792.98 - 2799.9: like dude gas that year and then country
2796.96 - 2802.37: and we'll let it self select the colors
2799.9 - 2806.39: but we could if we wanted to specify
2802.37 - 2807.74: marker equals dot and think the line
2806.39 - 2816.44: style will be fine already
2807.74 - 2820.72: oh no unrecognized character and oh okay
2816.44 - 2825.7400000000002: can't just do country we need to do gas
2820.72 - 2829.7: country look at that now we've got all
2825.74 - 2832.87: the different all the different
2829.7 - 2835.8799999999997: countries in our graph and you could
2832.87 - 2838.1: move there's ways within matplotlib to
2835.88 - 2840.23: like move the legend outside of the
2838.1 - 2842.87: graph I'm not going to go into that
2840.23 - 2844.34: right now but another I guess comment
2842.87 - 2846.08: that I have is whenever you're doing
2844.34 - 2849.17: anything with matplotlib or anything
2846.08 - 2850.88: with python in general is like quickly
2849.17 - 2853.85: do a google search like how to move
2850.88 - 2856.06: legend outside of matplotlib graph and
2853.85 - 2858.95: you'll find probably on Stack Overflow
2856.06 - 2860.48: within the first three searches someone
2858.95 - 2862.37: that had the same problem as you and
2860.48 - 2864.89: found an answer to it so I always
2862.37 - 2867.17: recommend doing that but this is kind of
2864.89 - 2869.12: cool that we were able to quickly graph
2867.17 - 2871.85: all these different lines for all the
2869.12 - 2874.72: different countries and if you wanted to
2871.85 - 2880.4: you could like create a list like
2874.72 - 2882.98: countries to look at maybe not the best
2880.4 - 2885.4100000000003: name and you could choose exactly which
2882.98 - 2888.11: ones you wanted to include and then you
2885.41 - 2890.96: would do if not equals a year and we
2888.11 - 2895.01: actually you could just do if country in
2890.96 - 2897.04: countries to look at you'll do this real
2895.01 - 2897.0400000000004: quick
2905.31 - 2916.87: if country in countries to look at so
2915.07 - 2920.23: you see this is another way we can graph
2916.87 - 2922.3599999999997: specific things cool cool cool all right
2920.23 - 2928.2400000000002: I'm gonna comment this out temporarily
2922.36 - 2929.83: and just leave I'll leave it I'll push
2928.24 - 2937.5699999999997: it to the github when we're done with
2929.83 - 2944.89: this video and it will uncon with this
2937.57 - 2946.81: again cool and yeah you can play around
2944.89 - 2948.79: with this style you can use the
2946.81 - 2950.73: shorthand notation or you can use the
2948.79 - 2953.29: long hand notation that we kind of used
2950.73 - 2955.27: here but you also can reference the
2953.29 - 2957.37: first video I posted on matplotlib to
2955.27 - 2957.97: really play around with your line graph
2957.37 - 2959.74: styles
2957.97 - 2961.33: alright we're pretty much known of this
2959.74 - 2963.49: graph but a lot of a couple final things
2961.33 - 2965.3199999999997: before I move on to the FIFA data and
2963.49 - 2968.35: doing some other graphs so the first
2965.32 - 2970.6000000000004: thing is changing up the font size I
2968.35 - 2973.39: mentioned this in the previous map plot
2970.6 - 2975.19: lib video I did but I thought I was
2973.39 - 2977.5: worth mentioning again so we can add a
2975.19 - 2979.75: font stick to our title and actually we
2977.5 - 2982.2: can add this to any text based label so
2979.75 - 2984.37: you also add it to the X label ony label
2982.2 - 2988.18: and we can do all sorts of different
2984.37 - 2989.95: tweaks to our font I put a list in the
2988.18 - 2991.8399999999997: description to all the different fonts
2989.95 - 2994.7799999999997: you can use here if you wanted to change
2991.84 - 2997.21: up the actual font type but I'm going to
2994.78 - 2999.94: keep the font type the same I'm going to
2997.21 - 3003.39: change the font weight I'm gonna make it
2999.94 - 3006.33: bold so you see it now it's not bold but
3003.39 - 3008.1299999999997: if I do this watch what happens now it's
3006.33 - 3010.0499999999997: bold and let's say I also wanted to
3008.13 - 3014.1600000000003: change the font size I would say font
3010.05 - 3018.8100000000004: size and let's say it's size 22 so now
3014.16 - 3022.83: we have a larger font maybe 18 is a
3018.81 - 3025.13: better value so we can do that you can
3022.83 - 3027.5099999999998: do that for any of your your labels
3025.13 - 3028.98: another thing we might want to do is
3027.51 - 3031.28: in the when I showed this graph
3028.98 - 3034.26: originally I also had of the year 2011
3031.28 - 3037.38: we don't have values for 2011 but maybe
3034.26 - 3039.7200000000003: you wanted to allow for the ability of
3037.38 - 3043.4700000000003: that showing up and maybe project where
3039.72 - 3048.6: they're going you could do Plus you take
3043.47 - 3052.95: your ticks and plus 2011 ah that did not
3048.6 - 3054.5099999999998: work so this is a litter this is a data
3052.95 - 3059.3399999999997: frame so you can't just directly add
3054.51 - 3061.2900000000004: 2011 so we need to make it a list still
3059.34 - 3063.06: didn't work and the problem is the data
3061.29 - 3065.96: frame is kind of weird when you add just
3063.06 - 3069.06: a direct list so you can do dot to list
3065.96 - 3072.63: and now do this now you see 2011 is
3069.06 - 3075.0: there and then if you wanted to actually
3072.63 - 3079.23: save this graph remember we can do plot
3075.0 - 3083.88: dot save fig we can give it a name so
3079.23 - 3086.58: gas price figure sure and remember when
3083.88 - 3089.2200000000003: we're saving if you change the DPI
3086.58 - 3091.08: you'll get a higher resolution image so
3089.22 - 3093.3199999999997: 300 is a good value this is gonna make a
3091.08 - 3096.83: pretty big image it's going to make a
3093.32 - 3100.29: 300 times eight which is 24 hundred by
3096.83 - 3102.54: 1500 image but so really you can play
3100.29 - 3105.06: around with this video but the higher
3102.54 - 3106.8: the resolution or higher dpi the higher
3105.06 - 3111.0: resolution image you're going to get so
3106.8 - 3115.92: whoo I want to say this is a PNG so if I
3111.0 - 3120.45: went into that folder that I had as you
3115.92 - 3123.57: can see where did it go refresh oh I
3120.45 - 3126.3599999999997: don't know where I'm saving this just
3123.57 - 3130.1400000000003: propose figure where are you alright
3126.36 - 3132.21: sorry I tipped us in wrong savefig and
3130.14 - 3133.56: you always just you can refresh and look
3132.21 - 3135.54: at the documentation I'm gonna have
3133.56 - 3137.07: government yeah I got an error here I
3135.54 - 3140.97: should have noticed that before but yeah
3137.07 - 3144.15: say fig one word do that now if I go to
3140.97 - 3148.41: the folder that I have these files in we
3144.15 - 3153.2400000000002: got gas price figure and if I bring that
3148.41 - 3157.41: in you see the figure there saves nicely
3153.24 - 3159.7799999999997: as a PNG all right let's move on to the
3157.41 - 3160.3489999999997: FIFA data now that we're done with the
3159.78 - 3162.779: gas price
3160.349 - 3164.279: stuff let's move on to using our FIFA
3162.779 - 3169.799: data so we're gonna first gonna have to
3164.279 - 3172.259: load it in so in if you didn't save the
3169.799 - 3176.519: FIFA data maybe skipped around this
3172.259 - 3178.349: video it's on my github page and the
3176.519 - 3179.1899999999996: link to that is in the description and
3178.349 - 3181.71: you want to save it in the same
3179.19 - 3185.94: directory of the file that you're using
3181.71 - 3189.779: to produce these graphs Lou I'm mixing
3185.94 - 3194.609: my words load FIFA data ok so to do that
3189.779 - 3198.809: we'll just call FIFA equals PD not read
3194.609 - 3202.89: CSV and I believe we called this FIFA
3198.809 - 3205.079: data dot CSV and that's just check make
3202.89 - 3206.819: sure it's loaded in properly cool and
3205.079 - 3209.549: this is actually shoot it shouldn't have
3206.819 - 3210.66: loaded at all ok it's still a preview
3209.549 - 3212.43: but you could do something if you only
3210.66 - 3216.45: wanted to see like the first 5 rows you
3212.43 - 3218.729: can do FIFA dot head five all right so
3216.45 - 3221.9399999999996: so you can get a feel for what's in this
321
